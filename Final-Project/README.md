Final-Project Proposal

For my final project, I will create a Spinning Globe using Three.js, a WebGL-based graphics library. The project will feature a 3D model of the Earth as a sphere, textured with a map of the globe. The globe will rotate continuously, simulating Earthâ€™s rotation, and will include lighting to enhance realism. The interactive feature will allow users to pause or resume the rotation using a button or keyboard input.

The spinning globe will demonstrate the use of geometric objects, texture mapping, and animation.
